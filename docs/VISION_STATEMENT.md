# Vision & Global Botanical Context

## The Problem: Data Fragmentation
In the world today, there is no single authoritative source for comprehensive plant information. Knowledge is siloed across thousands of institutions, websites, and registries. This presents several critical challenges:
- **Conflicting Data:** Significant discrepancies exist across different sites regarding plant hardiness, origins, and descriptions.
- **Fact vs. Opinion:** It is often difficult for researchers and gardeners to distinguish between verified botanical facts and horticultural opinions.
- **Name Collisions:** Different sites frequently use different names for the same plant, or the same name for different plants, with no universal catalog to resolve the ambiguity.
- **The Context Gap:** Authoritative scientific checklists (like WCVP) are excellent for nomenclature but often lack the rich horticultural context—size, color, growth rate, and cultivation history—required by enthusiasts and professionals.

## Three Levels of Botanical Reality
Plant information exists at three distinct layers, yet no universal system exists to tie them together holistically:
1.  **Higher Level Classification:** Categories above Genus (Families, Orders).
2.  **Natural Nomenclature:** Naturally occurring plants (Genus, Species, Infraspecies).
3.  **Cultivated Plants:** Human-selected variations (Cultivars, Grexes, Trade Names).

## The FloraCatalog Mission: Bridging the Gap
FloraCatalog is designed to address these siloes by connecting cultivated plant records to natural plant concepts. We build a multi-layered knowledge base upon the advanced work of existing authorities.

### 1. The Natural Core (WCVP)
We use the **World Checklist of Vascular Plants (WCVP)** as our foundational backbone. 
- **Role:** It provides the "Source of Truth" for natural nomenclature (Genus, Species, Infraspecies).
- **Status:** WCVP is the most trusted resource in the botanical community, serving as the backbone for major efforts like *Plants of the World Online (POWO)* and the *World Flora Online (WFO)*.

#### Why WCVP? (Scientific Justification)
FloraCatalog selects WCVP as its foundational backbone due to its unique combination of rigor and dynamism:
- **Expert-Driven Curation:** Status of every name is determined by expert compilers based on peer-reviewed literature and global consensus.
- **Evidence-Based Transparency:** Each taxonomic decision is explicitly linked to supporting references.
- **Temporal Coherence:** Offers "snapshots" of knowledge over time, tracking taxonomic changes rather than providing a static list.
- **Continuous Currency:** Incorporates user feedback and new publications weekly.
- **Community Trust:** Serves as the foundational "backbone" for the world's leading botanical gardens and research institutions.

### 2. The Cultivated Layer (ICRAs & Community)
We integrate lists from **International Cultivar Registration Authorities (ICRAs)**.
- **Role:** These organizations manage cultivar names following the *International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants (ICNCP)*.
- **Connectivity:** We tie these registration lists directly to the accepted WCVP natural plant names.
- **Non-Authoritative Cultivars:** Since many popular, accessible, and relevant cultivated plants do not get registered with an ICRA, FloraCatalog allows for the inclusion of these records. However, since these are not from an authoritative registration source, we prioritize "Trusted Sources" while visually distinguishing these records from authoritative data to maintain scientific integrity.

### 3. The Knowledge Layer: Rich Horticultural Context
Recognizing that authoritative lists often lack descriptive depth, FloraCatalog enriches records with community-vetted and AI-curated data:
- **Physical Description:** Granular data on size (height/width), shape, color, and texture for all plant parts (foliage, flowers, stems, and underground growth).
- **Temporal Dynamics:** Documentation of growth rates, seasonal variation, and flowering periods.
- **Environmental Needs:** Reliable data on growing conditions, hardiness, and ecological requirements.
- **Origin & History:** The "story" of a plant—its discovery, historical background, and development context.

### 4. Universal Nomenclature (A.K.A.)
Beyond scientific synonyms, FloraCatalog serves as a cross-reference for all names a plant is "Also Known As." This includes:
- **Commercial Designations:** Trade names, trademarks, and registered trademarks.
- **Legal Markers:** Plant patents and intellectual property designations.
- **Community Names:** Common names across multiple languages and regions.
- **Usage History:** Identification of misapplied names and common misrepresentations to resolve confusion in the trade.

### 5. Visual Identification & Media
A primary long-term goal is the integration of imagery to aid in identification and appreciation.
- **Scope:** Images documenting various aspects of the plant at different ages, stages of growth, and seasonal conditions.
- **Challenges:** We acknowledge the significant technical challenges (storage/hosting) and legal hurdles (licensing and copyright) associated with high-quality botanical imagery. Our strategy prioritizes linking to trusted external image repositories while selectively hosting community-contributed media.

## Conclusion
By synthesizing scientific rigor (WCVP) with horticultural registration (ICRAs) and rich descriptive context, FloraCatalog provides a path toward a holistic, trusted, and interconnected source of botanical information.
