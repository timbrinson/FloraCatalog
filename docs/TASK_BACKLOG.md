# Project Roadmap & Task Back backlog

This document tracks planned features and technical improvements to ensure continuity across development sessions.
## Work on Now
- [x] **Implement Ingestion Engine:** Rewrite the Add Plant functionality by following the Ingestion Engine design to implement the 6-stage validation pipeline (Stage 0: Deterministic Win, Stage 1: Intent Filter, Stage 2: Global synthesis, Stage 3: Polishing).

## Awaiting Verification (Recent Builds)
- [ ] **Find Plant Engine v2.35.0:** Verify the multi-candidate discovery logic and Stage 0 local search priority.

## High Priority
- [x] **Fix Finding Plant Details:** The Icon Button for searching for plant details doesn't function. Also the Icon is not obvious what it does. I'm not sure which of the two Icons to select but neither works. The Icon button needs a tool tip saying what it does.
    * **Human Note:** The Tooltips are working and do help. The icons are not obvious but maybe others would not either. Actions gets stuck with activity "Initializing AI curator..." and never finishes. The same wording is used in the Activity Panel for both so you can't tell them apart.
    > **AI Context:** Implemented the AI task orchestrator in handleAction (App.tsx). The "Pickaxe" button now triggers authoritative reference mining (findAdditionalLinks) and the "Wand" button triggers horticultural detail enrichment (enrichTaxon). Both tasks now update the database and grid state upon completion, resolving the "stuck" activity bug.
- [x] **Fix Missing Controls for Adding Plants:**
    * **Human Note:** Bulk Upload was removed as the AI rewrote the Add Plant interface after the file was corrupted where it simplified things due to many issues found when adding plants. Needs implemented again after the Ingestion Engine is implemented and ading a single plant is working smoothly.
    > **AI Context:** Implemented AddPlantModal with AI-assisted taxonomic parsing via Gemini 3 Pro. Restored Bulk Upload capability with .txt/.csv file parsing. Integrated all "Add" operations with the Activity Panel for asynchronous tracking and background processing. Cleaned up legacy files: PlantCard.tsx, ProcessMonitor.tsx, and defaultData.ts.
- [x] **Traceability & Lineage Framework:**
    * **Human Note:** Source Attribution was removed as the AI rewrote the Add Plant interface after the file was corrupted where it simplified things due to many issues found when adding plants. Needs implemented again after the Ingestion Engine is implemented.
    > **AI Context:** Implemented mandatory Source Attribution in AddPlantModal. Integrated app_data_sources registry to track "Who, What, When, and How." Manual additions now capture App Version (v2.18.0), process context, and timestamp. Locked down WCVP source from manual attribution selection. Added case-insensitive matching for lineage detection. Resolved statement timeouts in Purge utility by switching to ID-chained deletion.
- [ ] **Lineage Visuals:** We can show a true "Breadcrumb" in the Details Panel (e.g., Asparagaceae > Agave > parryi) by simply joining the names of the UUIDs in the path.
- [ ] **Loading on Demand:** Need ability to force loading records. Load an amount and/or load all children. They don't actually need to be loaded but they appear to be to the user.
- [ ] **Grid Virtualization:** Implement a virtual scrolling engine (e.g., react-window) to handle thousands of loaded rows without DOM degradation. This is critical for maintaining performance beyond the 5,000-record threshold.
- [ ] **Subtree Fetching:** We can perform a single query: WHERE hierarchy_path <@ 'root.family_id' to fetch every Genus, Species, and Cultivar in that family instantly. This is much faster than the current "fetch a batch and hope we have the parents" approach.

## Medium Priority
- [ ] **Update Defaults:** Now that I've had a chance to experiment with the customizations ad found good values we need to move them to be defaults.
- [ ] **Sorting on Family:** With the new grid tree using Authority (IDs) and Family colums/rows turned on, it is not sorting by genus and adding the family abve it. Can we make it sort on Family and group all the Genus under the one instance of a particular family?
- [ ] **Clean Up Zombie Scripts:** As we developed the manual and then automated installation scripts there were a lot of changes in order to get them to work. It is not clear which are still valid and which should be archoived or deleted. It would be good to maintain both path's for installation. The manual path is good for training someone to understand the steps. The automated one is best for productivity. We need to organize the long list of scripts by seting up functional and/or logical folders.
- [ ] **DataGrid & Model Consistency Audit:** Perform a line-by-line audit of DataGrid.tsx and the dataService.ts mappers to identify "Hidden Regressions." Specifically: (1) Ensure all cell renderers have type-safety checks to prevent rendering objects/arrays in spans, (2) Verify that every property used in the UI matches the Data Mapping document exactly (e.g., resolving the childCount vs descendantCount naming conflict), and (3) Ensure all ReactNode casting satisfies the compiler without using any.
- [ ] **Cache Limits:** If we keep scrolling in the grid it will continue to load more and more plants. We should have a caching scheme that can expire earlier loaded plants at some point. If the user scrolls back to to the top it would recache those that expired so that from the user's perspective it is continuous.
- [ ] **Fetch During Collapsed Tree View:** When the grid in tree view and it is collapsed to a partular level (1,2,3,etc.) where only a few plans are displayed then fetch more plants to ayt least fill the display and allow scrolling to fetch/load even more. 
- [ ] **Build Out Details Panel:** It would show all the data for the plant organized in sections. At least any sections with a lot of information is collapsable. Include origin, history, background. Include growing conditions. Include A.K.K section. Include Physical Description section. Give it an edit mode so data can be updated (for those with the correct role).
- [ ] **Inheriting from Parents:** Since lower level taxons are a specialization of the parent can they inherit certain attributes (inherited) if those attributes are not set an the child? This would not include things like status or authorship but would include climate, geography and lifeform. May want to make it clear to the user when a description is inherited (inherited) vs specific (specialized) to that taxon.
- [ ] **Redirecting to Accepted Taxon:** Need to figure out how to handle if someone searches/filters on a synonym, how to best direct them to the accepted taxa. Would be nice if it was done automatically. Would need to explain to the user since there would be a context shift. Might want to have synonyms (and other related taxa) show up as another level in the tree, below the accepted taxa. Or this could just be on the details panel.
- [ ] **A.K.A. in Details Panel:** Update the SynonymType under types.ts to be AKATypes with values to cover scientific (WCVP Accepted/Synonyms), trade names, trademarks, registered trademarks, patents, common names, Other Cultivars, misapplied, commonly misrepresented, unspecified, etc. Anchoring to scientific (WCVP) and horticultural (ICRA) standards is required. The Details Panel would have a collapsable section called "A.K.A". There would be a way to easily distinguish the AKATypes of the entries. If this taxon has an acceptedPlantNameId then the Taxon Name of it is shown with a link to that entry. If there are other plants with this acceptedPlantNameId for this plant then their Taxon Name of it is shown with a link to that entry. Include references to reputable websites. Include brief quotes about plants from reputable sources, with proper citing and references to the source. Follow guidance provided by Google AI - see document of session conversation.
- [ ] **Physical Description:**  Include as a section in the Details Panel. Include things like plant size-Height/width, growth rate, Plant shape, plant overall texture, floliage shape, foliage size, foliage texture, foliage color, variation throughout the year, Flowering period, flower color and description, description of base/rooting system- type (bulb, rhizonme, etc.), size, shape, etc. Also include special characteristics for the type of plant it is.
- [ ] **Define 'verification_level':** That field was an early prototype of an idea. We need to settle how best to use that field or whether it is needed or not.

## Low Priority
- [ ] **Personalized Collection:** There is a need for a user to identify the subset of plants they care about (personalized collection of data) so they don't have to weed through the full set of plants every time. 
- [ ] **Garden Collection:** There is a need for a user to track their own collection of plants that tie back to recorded plant info. 
- [ ] **Index Expansion:** Add indexes to all filterable columns in `app_taxa` to prevent 57014 Database Timeouts during complex grid filtering.
- [ ] **3-Tier Architecture Transition:** Move database logic to a dedicated server/API layer to support scaling beyond free-tier and browser limitations.
- [ ] **Infrastructure Maintenance:** Address the need for a paid Supabase plan as the database exceeds logical storage limits (~1.9GB currently).
- [ ] **Lifeform Multiselect Filter:** Create a multiselect filter for the lifeform_description column (which uses the Raunkiær terminology). Previous exact-match implementation (v2.18.2) proved insufficient for complex Raunkiær strings. Future implementation requires case-insensitive substring search or GIN-index support. Nice to have would be an extension to allow logical AND. Another nice to have extension would handle filtering based on logical subtypes and descritptive terms.
- [ ] **User Authentication:** Use the Supabase Authentication for end users. Turn on RLS. Use correct API Key (not anon).
- [ ] **Create Role Based Access:** Start with at least a readonly and a read/write (or admin) role. In future expand role to allow adding Cultivars and editing those that you add. Possibly this would be a role tied to particular plant types (e.g. conifers or succulents) or specific taxon layers (Acer palmatum or Hosta). Possibly another future role to add Genus, Species and Infraspecies.
- [ ] **Architect as 3 Tier App:** Makre sure this can run as a 3 tier app, even though testing in AI Studio would be running both a server and client tiers. What are options for where to run the server tier for a web application? What is the path to production? Automate as much as possible.
- [ ] **Offline Storage:** Use PouchDB/IndexedDB to allow full cataloging without an internet connection, syncing when online.
- [ ] **Export/Import:** Implement CSV/Excel export for the current filtered view in the Data Grid.
- [ ] **Real-time Sync:** Implement Supabase `REALTIME` listeners to update the grid automatically when background mining processes finish.
- [ ] **Image Integration:** Add support for `imageConfig` in Gemini to generate or fetch botanical illustrations for the `app_taxon_details` view.
- [ ] **Hybrid Formula Builder:** A UI tool to help users select two existing taxa to create a new Hybrid record with a valid `hierarchy_path`.
- [ ] **Advanced Filtering:** Add "Range" filters for numerical columns like `firstPublished`.
- [ ] **Geographic Mapping:** Use Gemini Maps Grounding to convert the `geographicArea` text strings into interactive map markers.
- [ ] **Extending Genus, Species, Infraspecies:** There is a lot of work done outside of WCVP that identifies plants which may eventually be adopted in WCVP. At this time I have not concluded whether to allow adding these to the app. First question is if we allowed adding Genus, Species and Infraspscies that are not in WCVP does this design support that or if it doesn't would it be difficult to add later?

## Documentation Quality & Sovereignty (Recurring)
- [ ] **Documentation Audit:** Periodically review all `docs/` files to ensure they remain human-readable and haven't drifted into "AI-only" technical jargon. Verify that the "Why" is as well-documented as the "How."
- [ ] **Knowledge Sovereignity Sync:** Ensure every major decision made during chat is reflected in an ADR or functional spec to prevent contextual drift in future sessions.

## Technical Debt / Polish
- [ ] **Mobile Responsiveness:** The Data Grid is currently optimized for desktop; implement a "Card View" fallback for mobile screens.
- [ ] **Query Optimization:** Move the "Hierarchy Path" calculation to a Postgres Trigger to remove the need for Step 7 in the manual build process.
- [ ] **Error Handling:** Add a global Error Boundary and more granular toast notifications for AI service timeouts.
- [ ] **Batch Purging Logic:** Implement a chunked deletion strategy for the "Purge Cultivars" tool in dataService.ts to avoid Postgres statement timeouts on large datasets.


## Archive
- [x] **Activity Panel Evolution:** Enhance the Task Orchestrator to support broader background operations. (1) Optimize the layout for monitoring multiple concurrent processes, (2) Implement "Task History" to allow users to review processing details and data outcomes after the fact for the duration of the current session, and (3) Implement interactive "Checkpoint" UI where the system pauses for user review before committing large-scale changes to the shared database. Make it possible to keep the activity panel open when doing other things like Add Plant, so that monitoring the process and debugging is more seemless. Each background process nees to provide detail information with the inputs for the process, showing the steps of teh process, the status of each step of the process and the key data used at each step. Start with providing these details for the Add Plant process.
- [x] **Include Class, Phylum and Kingdom:** Add columns in app_taxa for class, phylum and kingdom (done). Add UI grid columns and pallet color customization in Settings (done). Update build script to load Family, Order, Class, Phylum and Kingdom from wfo_import. If there are duplicate rows for the same name in WFO only load one into app_taxa, prioritising by their status in the order of Accepted, Synonym, Unchecked. Include the rank and status from WFO, changing case to match WCVP. Link the data that came from WFO in a parent/child hierarchy. Note that Family rows will be from WFO instead of being derived from the WCVP family column as has been done in the past.  When loading from wfo_import collapse the intermediate levels that are not loaded to app_taxa, such as if an order has a parent that is a subclass (since subcass does not get loaded into app_taxa) then derefeence it to find its parent class and set the order's parent in app_taxa as that class. This same pattern is followed at each level (class->subphyllum->phyllum, phyllum->subkingdom->kingdom, etc.). Alos note there are a few records from WFO that jump a few levels up so that some intermediate levels could be blank (e.g. order parents being phyllum instead of class). To link WCVP data to WFO data link all WCVP data that do not have a parent and do have a family column by matching the wcvp family column to the wfo scientificName. When matching wcvp children (e.g. genus) to their wfo parent, if the parent is a Synonym then dereference that to the accepted taxa. Implement literal propagation of the Kingdom, Phyllum, Class and Order for all lower level taxa. There are different ways to do this so propose a plan so we agree on the most efficient. Make sure the hierarchy includes all levels and counts are updated at all levels.
    * **Implementation Note (Jan 2026):** Transitioned Source ID 2 to World Flora Online (WFO) as the physical backbone source. Source ID 3 is now dedicated to Manual/User entries. Implemented "Authority-Relative" status mapping (WFO status mapped to Accepted, Synonym, Unchecked). Bridging nomenclature (WCVP/Manual) to Backbone (WFO) via string-literal matching on the `family` column. Implemented two-stage literal propagation: (1) Internal WFO walk to complete literal columns on backbone Families, and (2) Mass single-pass SQL update to flow those literals from Families to all 1.4M descendants sharing the family string.
- [x] **Fix stepBridgeFlow:** It appears this did not work. Genus has Kingdom (and assume Phyllum) but Species, Subspecies, Variety and Form do not. I think they all have Order as it was set during a previous task.
- [x] **Phylogenetic Extension (Order Level):** Extend the taxonomic hierarchy above the Family level by creating physical 'Order' records. This anchors the catalog to globally accepted phylogenetic standards: APG IV (Angiosperms), Christenhusz (Gymnosperms), and PPG I (Pteridophytes).
    * **Human Note:** Follow the implementation strategy defined in docs/design/ORDER_FAMILY_MAPPING_SPEC.md, prioritizing the WFO Backbone (Path A) for bulk efficiency. Use a new source based on where the data comes from.
    * **Human Note:** The WFO _DwC_backbone_R.zip file was downloaded 2026-01-09. That file contains one file named "classification.csv". This text is from https://www.worldfloraonline.org/downloadData: "When citing the World Flora Online, you may use: "WFO ([Year]): World Flora Online. Version [Year].[Month]. Published on the Internet; http://www.worldfloraonline.org. Accessed on:[Date]". Please ensure that the [Date] of accession accords with the date for your use of the system and the [Year] and [Month] correspond to the file you are using."
    * **Human Note:** If the "Hierarchy Build" (Step 11) appears to stall with 0 IOPs, use the updated `scripts/check_progress.sql.txt` to verify if a query is actually running in Postgres. If `pg_stat_activity` is empty, your Node.js process has likely hung or lost the socket connection; restart the build script and select Step 11 to resume.
    > **AI Context:** 
    1. Source Identification: Use `_DwC_backbone_R.zip` from WFO (v2025.12). **WARNING:** The `classification.csv` is ~950MB. Local pre-filtering (distillation) via `scripts/distill_wfo.py.txt` is mandatory to generate a manageable `wfo_import.csv` file.
    2. Automation: Aligned WFO import with the WCVP staging pattern. Steps 2, 5, and 9 handle WFO-specific logic. **v2.31.9 update:** Step 5 now includes a self-healing `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` block to allow enriching an existing DB without a schema reset.
    3. Creation: Step 9 now uses SQL set logic to populate all Orders from `wfo_import` and link 'Derived' Family records to their phylogenetic parents.
    4. Citation: "WFO (2025): World Flora Online. Version 2025.12. Published on the Internet; http://www.worldfloraonline.org. Accessed on: 2026-01-09".
    5. Hierarchy: Re-running Step 11 (Hierarchy Build) shifts the entire database tree down, anchoring it to the new Order roots. **Optimization Note:** Step 13 now includes the `idx_build_path_null` partial index specifically to speed up child-matching during this phase.
    6. **Status (2026-01-10):** Build Successful. Verified 508 Orders and 471 Families acting as phylogenetic roots. Verified ~773k records successfully path-calculated. Next Phase: Synonym Grafting to bring the remaining ~660k synonyms into the tree hierarchy.
- [x] **Create Records for Family:** We have done a lot of work to accomodate Family level when it exists as an attribute and not a record or WCVP rank. Should we create records for all Family values used in WCVP? We would add teh Family Rank as an extension (like was done for Cultivar). We would need a special Status as well like 'Generated' or Extrapulated', that is an extension of teh WCVP vales (like was done for Registered and Provisional). 
- [x] **Fix Expand/Collapse Levels:** This functionality was developed for the older string based hierarchy and does not work with Authority (IDs) for hierarchy, other than Family level.
- [x] **Remove the Legacy (String) Mode:** It is no longer needed since Authority (IDs) has been implemented, is stable and working well.
- [x] **Index Cleanup and Refinement:** Update manual and automated DB installation scripts where needed Output any new scripts that need to be ran manually. Indicate any inndices that need to be removed manually.
    * **Human Note:** idx_app_taxa_name_sort is currently defined in the DB as: CREATE INDEX idx_app_taxa_name_sort ON public.app_taxa USING btree (taxon_name). I recall there was a COLLATE "C" in some index in the past but wonder if it was inadvertently removed during a debug session. 
    * **Human Note:** I ran the script. I notice that filtering on Status = Accepted and (Rank = Form or I Rank = f.) causes a timeout but no other Ranks or I Ranks do.. Doing the same query in Supabase returns fast results.
    * **Human Note:** I ran the SQL. It had a couple timeouts early on but is working better now that I exercised it a few times.. There were a couple messages in the javascript console "Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 500 ()". When selecting the link in the error gives "{"message":"No API key found in request","hint":"No `apikey` request header or url param was found."}"
    > **AI Context:** Diagnostic analysis suggests the 500/API key error was caused by unquoted multi-word string literals in PostgREST 'or' filters (e.g., 'Artificial Hybrid'), which mangled the request URL structure. Hardened dataService.ts v2.30.2 to enforce quoting. Upgraded indices to V8.1 (Sort-Inclusive). Audit confirmed redundancy: removed shadowed wcvp_id, status, and rank indexes to reclaim space. Sparse rank timeouts mitigated to less than 1s.
- [x] (To be replaced with new Ingestion Engine Design) **Redesigned "Add Plant" Process to Follow Hybrid Intelligence Framework.**
- [x] **Implement Grid Display Spec:** Fix the hierarchical display of plants in tree mode by following the Grid Display Spec design.
- [x] **Load "virtual-root" Parents (Hydration):** Trigger a fetch to replace the virtual-root with the real parent record.
- [x] **Fixed Fragmentation:** Resolved the "Double Family" bug where cultivars like 'Back in Black' would split.
- [x] **Virtual Row for Generic  Cultivars:** Add a virtual group under Genus to hold generic cultivars.
- [x] **Fix Order for GH and SH:** Move GH before Genus. Move SH before Species.
- [x] **Fix Legend:** It disappeared. (Restored in v2.28.1).
- [x] **Fix Bolding/Dimming:** Some conditions get double dimming.
- [x] **Fix leading X Rule:** treat genus starting X as a hybrid.
- [x] **Simplify Legend Colors:** Remove the specific infraspecies ranks (Subspecies, Variety, Form) and just have Infraspecies to represent any of them. Replace Subvariety and Subform with just 'Other'.
- [x] **Rethink Status Selector Colors:** The green for Accepted and Artificial Hybrid looks too much like the green for Genus. Everything else is currently just black (or dark gray) on white for Accepted, Articial Hybrid and Registered. Use dark gray on white for Provisional. Use dark gray on light gray for all others.
- [x] **UI to Save Config State:** Provide a UI for the user to explicitly save the config state as opposed to saving it automatically everytime something is changed. Also provide a way to refresh the state from the settings that have been saved.
- [x] **Remove Column Borders:** A couple columns have a border on the right side. Remove it fromm the tree column and the Count column.
- [x] **Pallet for Grid Colors:** Update the configurability of the grid colors. Replace the 4 options 1a, 1b, 2a, and 2b with ability to customize the colors. The customization has selections for each of the five grid levels (family, genus, species, infraspecies, cultivar) with the base Tailwind CSS v3 color, weight for cell wash/background, weight for text, weight for badge wash/background and weight for badge border. Place these toward the bottom of the Seetings panel, above Maintenance.
- [x] **Status Values as Text:** The status values in the grid are badges which draws too much attention to them. Change them to just text (regular font).
- [x] **Rank Values Not Bold:** The rank values in the grid are badges with bold text. Change them to regular font but keep them as badges.
- [x] **Direct Child Count Fix (Jan 2026):** Resolved the recursive count repair stall by pivoting to a high-speed direct child aggregation strategy. Optimized Step 12 in the build script and Step 7 in the repair utility. Updated ADR-002 and GRID_SPEC to reflect the navigational clarity of immediate child counts.
- [x] **Hybrid Order & Segment Optimization (Jan 2026):** Fixed missing Order propagation for genus hybrids starting with symbols (+, ×) by expanding segment boundaries. Optimized count updates by batching them across 21 segments to prevent database timeouts.
- [x] **Zombie Session Mitigation (Jan 2026):** Resolved Step 1 hangs in the repair utility by implementing lock-agnostic schema checks and identifying orphaned Postgres backends consuming disk IO.
- [x] **Symbol-Inclusive Propagation & Catch-all (Jan 2026):** Fixed missing Order literals for genus hybrids by using absolute Unicode segment boundaries and implementing a recursive catch-all Order inheritance pass in the repair utility.
- [x] **NOWAIT Lock Protection (Jan 2026):** Hardened Step 1 of the repair utility to fail fast during lock contention and provide PID-level blocker diagnostics.
- [x] **Hang Watcher & Throttling (Jan 2026):** Resolved Step 5 "Idle Hangs" in the repair utility by adding a Hang Watcher that probes the DB for locks during long queries. Implemented segment throttling (200ms delay) to prevent lock-starvation between the script and background database maintenance tasks.
- [x] **Repair Resume Support (Jan 2026):** Implemented interactive "Resume" support in the repair utility to skip completed heavy Order propagation passes and go directly to count repair. Added Query 16 to the diagnostic script for quick repair-progress audits.
- [x] **Smart Reset & Vacuum (Jan 2026):** Optimized Step 5 of the repair utility (v1.4.6) with a "Smart Reset" that only touches records with non-zero counts. This bypasses ~1.4M unnecessary row updates, significantly mitigating the "0 IOPS Hang" caused by transaction log saturation. Added Query 17 for targeted session termination.
- [x] **Nuclear Reset & Zombie Count Fix (Jan 2026):** Resolved the "Zombie Recursive Count" bug (e.g. Poaceae showing 60k descendants) by implementing a Global Nuclear Reset in Step 5 of the repair utility (v1.4.7). This ensures all old counts are zeroed before segmented recalculation, bypassing segmented reset failures caused by database locks. Added Query 18 for verification.
- [x] **Atomic Segmented Repair (Jan 2026):** Overhauled Step 5 in the repair utility (v1.4.8) to use Atomic Segmented Updates. This logic directly overwrites counts with the physical child total in a single transaction per segment, eliminating the dependency on a prior reset pass and effectively clearing persistent zombie recursive data from all ranks.
- [x] **Direct Child Count Verification (Jan 2026):** Confirmed through manual SQL audit that high counts (e.g. Poaceae at 60,609 and Asteraceae at 86,392) are legitimate direct-child population figures in the database, not recursive errors. Finalized repair utility (v1.4.8) with Atomic Segmented logic to maintain robust synchronization with physical database state.
